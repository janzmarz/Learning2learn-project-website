  <p class="main-head">
    The purpose of this website is to showcase the content of the course in a simple
    but effective manner. As Barbara and Terry said themselves, to truly understand a 
    subject, you must be able to teach it - so here it goes!

  <h3> Focused vs Diffuse thinking</h3>
  <p class="focused-vs-diffuse">
    As discussed in the course materials, diffuse mode thinking can be compared to
    a pinball machine where the pins are loosely spaced and the ball can move freely
    around the machine. On the other hand, focused mode thinking is like a pinball
    machine where the pins are closely spaced, making it difficult for the ball to 
    move around freely. Focused thinking is useful when you are trying to learn a 
    new concept and need to concentrate on the task at hand. However, for the most 
    effective learning, you should use both modes of thinking in combination.
