    I want to express my sincere gratitude to you if you have taken the time to go through all the content on this page. 
    I enrolled in this course to improve my web development skills and overcome my lack of motivation to learn. At the 
    beginning of the course, I had no knowledge of the essential learning skills, and I lacked any computer programming skills. 
    However, I managed to learn all the skills that you see on this page while studying for this course. Thanks to this course, 
    I was able to progress significantly.
    <br><br>
    I have built this web page from scratch, including all the coding and styling by myself, with the help of various books and 
    online resources. I have invested a lot of time into creating this page, and I hope that you have enjoyed it. It serves as a 
    testament to my progress in this course, as well as my journey in web development. Thank you for visiting.
    <br><br>
    And on that note, I’m Jan Zmarzly, thanks for learning – how to learn.
