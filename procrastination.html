  <h3> Procrastination</h3>
  <p class="procrastination">
    Procrastination is a common problem in today's world. It's not as difficult to avoid as people might think. We 
    often procrastinate because we're constantly distracted by our devices and other things. When we're faced with 
    a task that we don't want to do, our brain tries to find alternatives to avoid negativity. This leads to distraction 
    and the release of dopamine in our brains, creating a vicious cycle that reinforces the neural pathway for procrastination. 
    This cycle is similar to addiction.
    <br><br>
    An analogy that can help us understand the negative effects of procrastination is the story of people who used to microdose 
    themselves with poisons to build up resistance. While they could eventually consume a large dose of poisons, it was damaging 
    their health and lead to an early death in the long term. Similarly, procrastination won't kill you, but the more you 
    procrastinate, the more your brain becomes accustomed to it and sees it as a viable alternative to doing the work you should 
    be doing. It's like building up a tolerance to a drug, and it can become more challenging to focus and avoid procrastination 
    with willpower alone.
    <br><br>
    Willpower should be treated as a precious, limited resource and used sparingly in important situations. It's important to 
    avoid overusing it, as it can become fragile. Additionally, our self-esteem is often linked to our capacity for willpower, 
    making it even more vulnerable. However, when used sparingly, willpower can be effective in breaking the habit of procrastination.

  <h3>Habits</h3>
  <p class="procrastination">
    Procrastination is a habit that can be tough to break. Creating new habits is similar to chunking, which means that you need to 
    consciously process input data to your brain. With practice, you can move from consciously processing data to processing it 
    subconsciously. Eventually, you won't even think about the finer details of the habit you've formed, but instead, you will have 
    a subconscious understanding of the habit's subject matter as a whole. Examples of this can include riding a bike, backing out 
    of a driveway, or executing a maneuver in martial arts. (For more information on this topic, check out Josh Waitzkin's book, 
    The Art of Learning.) Habit formation works the same way; it starts out consciously and then becomes a subconscious execution 
    without even having to think about it.
  </p>
  <ol class="pomodoro1">
    <li>Cue: An event that triggers the habit.</li>
    <li>Routine: The response made by your inner zombie in response to the cue.</li>
    <li>Reward: Dopamine-releasing response when the routine is completed.</li>
    <li>Belief: Our mental rationale to keep a habit going; believing it’s beneficial, or that you’re physically unable to kick said habit.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="procrastination">
    Habits are maintained through the belief stage. Often, we justify our habits by rationalizing them. For instance, we may procrastinate 
    and justify it by saying that we need to take a break to prevent burnout. To avoid this pattern of thinking, it is helpful to focus on 
    the process rather than the end result. For example, working on a problem set for 25 minutes at a time rather than trying to finish 
    the entire set in one go.
