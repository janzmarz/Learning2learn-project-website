  <h3> The Pomodoro technique</h3>
  <p class="pomodoro1">
    The Pomodoro Method is a time management technique that involves breaking work into intervals
    of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique helps to overcome the mental 
    exhaustion caused by prolonged periods of work. It is based on the idea that we can remain 
    fully focused for around 25 minutes without experiencing any performance loss. After this period, 
    the Diffuse Mode takes over, allowing the brain to rest and consolidate the learned material. 
    This method is an effective way to increase productivity and improve learning outcomes.
    <br><br>
    The Pomodoro Technique was created by developer and entrepreneur Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s 
    when he was a university student. He used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to organize his study schedule. 
    Initially, he experimented with different work intervals ranging from two minutes to one hour. However, 
    he found that these intervals were becoming too long to stay focused on a task. Eventually, he settled 
    on 25-minute pomodori as the optimal time for his needs.
    <br><br>
    Cirillo gained a valuable insight from his experience that time can be utilized as an ally instead of a source 
    of stress. The Pomodoro Technique is designed to enhance people's ability to concentrate on tasks by limiting 
    the duration of time they spend on it and ensuring that they take restorative breaks. This method is also 
    effective in helping them overcome their tendency to procrastinate or multitask, both of which can negatively 
    impact productivity.

  <h3>5 step process</h3>
  <p class="pomodoro1">
    The Pomodoro Technique's Core Process defines five steps to stay focused on tasks throughout the day, serving 
    as a foundation for sustainable productivity: </p>
    <ul class="pomodoro1">
      <li>Choose a task for the current pomodoro.</li>
      <li>Set the timer to 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Work on the task until the timer sounds, then record completion of the pomodoro.</li>
      <li>Take a short break; start with five minutes but know that it can be as little as two minutes.</li>
      <li>After four pomodori, take a longer break; this is generally 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
   <p class="pomodoro1"> 
    To make the most of each pomodoro, allocate some time for reviewing the work you have done and planning for the 
    next pomodoro. It is essential to stay focused during the pomodoro and avoid any interruptions. To remain concentrated 
    on the task, individuals should protect their pomodoro from both internal and external distractions. One should refrain 
    from checking emails, social network accounts, weather reports, news outlets, or any other distractions that can divert 
    attention from the task at hand.
